THE SIGN IS A SUBTLE JOKE. THE SHOP IS CALLED "SNEED'S FEED & SEED", WHERE 
FEED AND SEED BOTH END IN THE SOUND "-EED", THUS RHYMING WITH THE NAME OF 
THE OWNER, SNEED. THE SIGN SAYS THAT THE SHOP WAS "FORMERLY CHUCK'S", IMPLYING 
THAT THE TWO WORDS BEGINNING WITH "F" AND "S" WOULD HAVE ENDED WITH "-UCK", 
RHYMING WITH "CHUCK". SO, WHEN CHUCK OWNED THE SHOP, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED 
"CHUCK'S FUCK AND SUCK".
